# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-ML
I am comparing different machine learning models for predicting heart disease. The models were trained and evaluated on a dataset of patients with various health metrics and symptoms.

## ML Models Used 

Models used are Linear Regression, k-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. 

## Dataset 

The dataset contains records for 304 patients, with 14 features including age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and symptoms like chest pain and shortness of breath. The target variable is a binary classification of whether or not the patient has heart disease. 

## Results
The accuracy values for each model are as follows:

- Linear Regression: 0.55
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): 0.92
- Logistic Regression: 0.86
- Decision Tree: 0.86
- Random Forest: 0.91
- Support Vector Machines (SVM): 0.88

## Future Work
While these results are promising, more work must be done to improve the accuracy and robustness of the heart disease prediction models. Some possible areas for future work include:

- Experiment with different feature engineering techniques and feature selection methods to see if they can improve the accuracy of the models.
- Trying out different machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks or gradient boosting, to see if they can outperform the current models.
- Collecting more data and exploring different data sources to see if the models can be improved with more diverse and representative data.
